## Sorani2KurmanjiLiterTran is a literal (word-for-word) translator.
## It uses a dictionary to replace any Sorani word with its equivalent Kurmanji.
## If no such equivalent were found, then the word is left as it was.
## For those words that found in the dictionary, but with their equivlent Kuramnji
## reamind un-set, the dictionary has added two qustion marks ("??")
## to the endo of the word, in order to make the process of setting the reight
## equivalent later.
