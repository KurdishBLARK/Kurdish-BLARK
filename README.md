# Kurdish-BLARK
This project composes of two components. 
The first one is a set of basic tools which have been developed as part of Kurdish BLARK project (see https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Hossein_Hassani11).
The second is corpora of Kurmanji and Sorani dialects of Kurdish.
The tools have been developed in Python (2.7). 
The tools currently include:
a transliterator that transliterates Persian/Arabic texts into Latin script,
a tokenizer which tokenizes the texts and uses RE to remove special characters and numeral tokens,
a stemmer to find Kurmanji and Sorani stems,
a word level literal translator based on a bidialectal dictionary to perform a literal translation from Kurmanji to Sorani and vice versa,
a Kurdish proper names recognizer,
and several other tools for building dictionaries and keeping them sorted.
The codes include comments which help in understanding the logics.
