a stemmer to find Kurmanji and Sorani stems,
a worl level literal translator based on a bidalect dictionary to performa literal translation from Kurmanji to Sorani and viceversa,
a Kurdish proper names recognizer,
and several other tools for building dictionaries and keeping them sorted.
The codes include comments which help in understanding the logics.
